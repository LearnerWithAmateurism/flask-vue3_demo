# flask-vue3_demo

#### Description
This is a Flask + Vue3 demo project,  
which is  a simple demo to showcase my previous experience with Flask and Vue3.

Currently, the Flask project actualizes a user managment service, which provides application interfaces for user registration, login, logout, and more.   
The interfaces in api4Test are for testing purposes, specifically for the [autotest demo project](https://gitee.com/bulbulbard/pytest_autotest-demo.git) that I written.
#### Software Architecture
The backend service is based on python3.11.  
Flask is the main framework, with Mysql as the database and Redis for data caching and message queue.

The frontend service is based on Vue3.

Additionally, containerization tools such as docker and docker-compose are used to support the web service's runtime environment.
